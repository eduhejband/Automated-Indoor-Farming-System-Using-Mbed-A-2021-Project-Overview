# Indoor Farming Automation Project with Mbed

## Description

This project aims to automate an indoor farming system using the Mbed platform to simulate temperature and ventilation control. The implementation involves the use of microcontrollers to monitor and adjust environmental conditions precisely, ensuring an ideal environment for plant growth.

## Features

- **Temperature Control:** Monitors and adjusts the internal temperature to maintain optimal levels for farming.
- **Ventilation Control:** Regulates airflow to ensure proper circulation and maintain controlled humidity.
- **Complete Automation:** The entire process is automated, eliminating the need for constant manual adjustments.

## Technologies Used

- **Mbed Platform:** Used for programming and managing the microcontrollers.
- **Microcontrollers:** Responsible for monitoring and controlling environmental variables.

## How It Works

1. **Continuous Monitoring:** Sensors collect data on temperature and ventilation within the environment.
2. **Data Processing:** Microcontrollers process the data in real-time to determine the necessary actions.
3. **Automatic Adjustment:** Based on the processed data, the system automatically adjusts the temperature and ventilation to optimize the farming environment.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the feasibility of automating environmental control in indoor farming systems using the Mbed platform to ensure efficiency and precision. Automation allows the creation of an optimized environment for plant growth, with minimal user intervention required.
